# LIFE OF PI
Yes! It is a movie. To showcase my frontend skills, I've decided to create a website dedicated to one of my favorite films, **Life of Pi**. It is truly a masterpiece,
depicting the journey of a teenage boy from a sunken ship to an unknown destination. He isn't alone in his adventure, he's  accompanied by a Bengal Tiger.

This website contains an intro page and few chapters describing the beauty of the movie.

## Intro Page
It displays the video of few beautiful scenes in the movie. After completion of video, it displays the hero section and the list of chapters with corresponding images.
